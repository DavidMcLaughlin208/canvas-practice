# Cascading Pixels

This project began by experimenting with the JavaScript canvas and has turned into an experiment in basic physics simulation.

The aim is to provide the user with a wide array of settings and functionality to let them play in the physics sandbox. 

Endless patterns can be formed and mesmerizing art can be created.
